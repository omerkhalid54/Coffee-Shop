            <h3>what makes our coffee special?</h3>
            <p>We buy only from reputable farmers and millers at volumes equal to several hundred acres. We grade our coffees into different sizes and quality, throw out the lower quality beans and blind taste our grades and types individually to find the best roasting temperature that bring out the best taste for that specific size and coffee bean different roasting temperatures for different coffee. We do this constantly to maintain a consistent and high-quality roast every time.</p>
